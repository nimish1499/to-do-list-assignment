# Todo Application

This project is a simple Todo application built with React and Redux. It allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and persists the state in local storage.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- Implement a to-do widget following the provided UI design.
- Enable data entry via a text field at the bottom of the widget with each entry having a checkbox to toggle completion status.
- Manage the to-do list data within a global state using Redux for persistence across page refreshes.
- Prioritize user experience and accessibility while ensuring the code is modular to accommodate future requirements with minimal changes.
- Maintain a well-organized file hierarchy and adhere to best practices for naming conventions within the Redux store and the application's source code.
